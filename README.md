## DenseLayer Neural Network

This repository contains a Python code snippet that demonstrates the implementation of a simple neural network using the torch library. 
The code defines a dense (fully connected) layer and applies it to a random input tensor.

The code comprises two primary components:

1. <b>DenseLayer Class</b>: The DenseLayer class represents a single dense (fully connected) layer of a neural network. It initializes the layer with random weights and biases.
   The forward method performs a forward pass, computing the output of the layer.

1. <b>Example Usage</b>: The code demonstrates how to create an instance of the DenseLayer class and use it to process a random input tensor. It prints the input and the
   output of the first and second layers to the console.
